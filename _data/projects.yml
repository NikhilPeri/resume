  description:
    uOttawa's first aerospace and rocketry team. Built a rocket which utilized a dynamic braking system
    to precisely carry and 8.8lb payload to 10,000 feet. Started as a small group of students experimenting with rockets
    to a multidisciplinary team of 30+ students.  Competed in 2019 and placed 4th out of 126 competitors to and one of 24 teams
    selected to deliver a podium presentation on the technology behind the <a href="https://github.com/uorocketry/barista">air braking system</a>.

  description:
    Predict the speed of a vehicle given 17 minutes of continous video data. I developed a block based splitting algorithm to improve reliability
    of cross-validation on such a small video dataset.  I also improved the generalization performance of the optical flow model by including a semantic segmentation capable of
    differentiating fixed and dynamic objects

  description:
    Organized the first "live" programming competition. Built a simulated stock trading environment where prices
    are simulated using an algorithm based on brownian motion. During the 8-hour competition teams had to work fast to build
    and deploy a realtime trading algorithm.

- project: Dataland
  role: Hacker

  description:
    Personal project to run data services for personal experimentation at hacker scale. Serves as an environment
    to run scheduled data mining tasks, as well as pipelines for data modeling and transformations.  Complete with data backups
    log notifications. Currently hosts the <a href="https://github.com/NikhilPeri/proline">Proline Sports Betting</a> project among other
    smaller data projects.
