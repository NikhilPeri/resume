- project: uOttawa Rocketry Team
  role: Co-Founder & Design Lead
  duration: Sept. 2015 &mdash; Present

  description:
    uOttawa's first aerospace and rocketry team. Built a rocket which utilized a dynamic braking system
    to precisely carry an 8.8lb payload to 10,000 feet. Started as a small group of students experimenting with rockets
    to a multidisciplinary team of 20+ students.  Competed in 2018 and one of 24 teams selected from 126 competitors to
    deliver a podium presentation on the technology behind the air braking system.

- project: Comma.ai Speed Challenge
  #role: Hacker
  url: https://github.com/NikhilPeri/speedchallenge
  #duration: May 2018 &mdash; Present
  description:
    Developed a solution combining semantic segmentation with optical flow to produce speed estimations from video frames.
    Leveraged the  <a href="https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Deep Drive</a> dataset to train a u-net for classifying
    static and dynamic objects in a video frame.  Then used this segmentation model to mask the dense optical flow between two frames.
    This allowed the model to differentiate relative motion of dynamic objects (ex. cars, people) from static objects (ex. trees, bridges).

- project: Surface Predictions Challenge
  #role: Hacker

  #duration: May 2018 &mdash; Present
  description:
    Ranked in the top 3% of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019/leaderboard">kaggle competition</a>
    to predict the surface beneath a moving robot given inertial data.  Trained a model on FFT spectrograms and
    Wavelet Transformation spectrograms.  Also utilized reslicing of time series signals as a data augmentation
    method to improve accuracy.

- project: Ontario Engineering Competition
  role: Programming Competition Director
  # duration: 2007 &mdash; Present

  description:
    Organized the first "live" programming competition. Built a simulated stock trading environment where prices
    are simulated using an algorithm based on brownian motion. During the 8-hour competition teams had to work fast to build
    and deploy a realtime trading algorithm.

- project: Dataland
  role: Hacker
  url: https://github.com/NikhilPeri/data-land
  duration: May 2018 &mdash; Present
  description:
    Personal project to run data services for personal experimentation at hacker scale. Serves as an environment
    to run scheduled data mining tasks, as well as pipelines for data modeling and transformations.  Complete with data backups
    log notifications. Currently hosts the <a href="https://github.com/NikhilPeri/proline">Proline Sports Betting</a> project among other
    smaller data projects.
