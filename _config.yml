resume_header_intro: >
  I am a licensed pilot, founder of uOttawa Rocketry and have been a garage tinker'er my entire life.
  I live with the philosophy <i>- Do what you can't</i>, and wish to work in an environment where
  people get the license to step out of their comfort zone.
  I do not claim to know everything; but do claim to be able to learn anything.
  This resume is a short story of the work I have done, if you would like to hear more I would be happy to chat
